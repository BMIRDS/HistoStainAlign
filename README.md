# HistoStainAlign

![Framework](support/framework.png)

**HistoStainAlign** is the official repository for the paper:  
[Cross-Modality Learning for Predicting IHC Biomarkers from H&E-Stained Whole-Slide Images](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2506.15853).

HistoStainAlign enables cross-modality prediction of immunohistochemistry (IHC) biomarkers from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs), leveraging deep learning and domain adaptation.

## Features

- **Tile Embedding Extraction**: Process WSIs to extract tile-level embeddings using Gigapath.
- **Flexible Training**: Train models with customizable classification heads.
- **Slide-Level Embedding Generation**: Aggregate tile embeddings for slide-level analysis.
- **Evaluation Tools**: Includes linear probe scripts for benchmarking embeddings.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BMIRDS/HistoStainAlign.git
    cd HistoStainAlign
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    - All Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    - Additionally, install [Gigapath](https://github.com/prov-gigapath/prov-gigapath) and its dependencies:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/prov-gigapath/prov-gigapath.git
        cd prov-gigapath
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

## Usage

The workflow consists of four main steps:

1. **Extract tile embeddings**
    - `00_extract_tile_embeds.py`: Use Gigapathâ€™s tile encoder to generate embeddings.
2. **Train the model**
    - `01_train_model_with_classification_head.py`: Train using the HistoStainAlign framework.
3. **Generate slide-level embeddings**
    - `02_generate_slide_embeddings.py`: Aggregate tile embeddings for each WSI.
4. **Evaluate with linear probe**
    - `03_run_linear_probe.py`: Assess slide embeddings using linear probing.

Refer to comments within each script for detailed usage and parameter options.
